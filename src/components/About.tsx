            Hi,<br />
            I am Sarwani.
          </p>

          <p>
            Everyone said, "Engineering kar lo bohot scope hai." (Do engineering, there's a lot of scope.) No one said, "scope engineering chhoddne ka hai." (The scope is in quitting engineering.).
          </p>

          <p>
            So, I did engineering from NIT. The degree's gathering dust. The experiences aren't. As an engineer, solving whatever brief life throws at me is my real USP.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've dabbled in TVCs, print, OOH, digital, influencer briefs, radio ads, social posts, dark posts, 'witty' comments, and emailers. Basically, everything that sharpens a copywriter's edge.
          </p>

          <p>
            I write in Hindi and English, and dream of trying Bengali, Punjabi, Urdu, even Bhojpuri - India's languages are my playground.
          </p>

          <p>
            And yes, I have a soft spot for jingles and songs, especially in Hindi.
            <br />
            Because let's face it - Urdu is beautiful, English is elite, but Hindi? Hindi is dheeth. It refuses to be ignored.
            <br />
            "Arey, kya hai?", "Waah!", "Pchhh!" The sound of these words alone reminds you of the power this language carries.
            <br />
            That's why I'm often caught humming songs (either for their brilliant lyrics or for lyrics so terrible, they're brilliant) while writing in Hindi.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lastly, I love words. And that's exactly why I'm a copywriter. Chasing the right words for a line that's simple and just CLICKS!
